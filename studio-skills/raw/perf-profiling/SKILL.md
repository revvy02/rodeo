# Roblox Performance Profiling

Let's learn how to profile Roblox games programmatically on clients, servers, and in Studio.

LibMP is a Luau module used to profile the performance of Roblox games. Profiling can be done in the game client's or server's scripts in real time (as we gather profiling information), or through Studio MCP's `execute_luau` command or the Studio command bar once the data has been collected and is static. The former is good for lightweight, targeted checks (as we should not influence frame time much with the checks themselves). The latter is better for deeper and longer analysis, allowing more frames, threads, and code scopes to be analyzed at once without affecting the client's frame time.

All information visually available in the MicroProfiler (MP) UI is accessible programmatically via LibMP. In Studio, MicroProfiler data is accessible in both Play and Edit modes.

**Limitations:** Currently, scope labels are not available (the text labels placed inside scope instances on the timeline by the Engine to describe processing details, not to be confused with scope/timer names/tags). Because of this, automatic script scopes are shown as "$Script" rather than "Script_MyScriptName". However, manually annotated scopes using `debug.profilebegin` / `debug.profileend` are displayed correctly. Also, only original/raw profiling data is provided, not derived data. There are no built-in average/min/max times; you must calculate these manually from the raw data if needed. Conversely, the previously unavailable history of counter values is now accessible.

### Sessions & Capturing

The main object is a `Session`. It can be created from Live Data (the data that the MicroProfiler currently holds and displays to the user). The MP can be enabled/disabled and capture can be activated/paused. When active, it collects a new frame each tick and evicts the oldest frame(s). A maximum of 256 recent frames can be held.

A Session tracking Live Data is supposed to be created once (not every frame) and reused as needed. When the MP is actively capturing, the first data retrieval call to LibMP will synchronize the Session with the MP data state in the Engine. When the MP is paused, using LibMP in the current and subsequent frames will not trigger a data sync; you will simply work with the data that was already synced. (A rare exception occurs if the MP is paused for a long time and an OS thread is deleted; in this case, the Session will sync on the next LibMP call).

A typical workflow when a frame time fluctuation is noticed is to wait briefly to collect a few more frames, then snapshot the MP data into a Luau buffer object. You can then create a new, independent Session from that buffer's data. This allows you to work with the exact same dataset indefinitely. This is especially useful when running LibMP in the Studio command bar or via MCP's execute_luau.

Of course, "frame time fluctuations" is a broad term. It can refer to generally poor performance, individual frame spikes, or sustained periods of slightly elevated frame times due to GPU bottlenecks. You can analyze not only total frame time but also individual code Scope times, or the time spent by groups of scopes (e.g., Physics). This can be measured as the sum of CPU core times or as real-world elapsed time (which differ during parallel execution). Analyze rare spikes separately from steady-state bottlenecks. A single 600 ms stall can dominate averages and hide the normal bottleneck. These concepts are common in game profiling and are not specific to LibMP. 

### Basic Entities

* **Frames:** The timeline is continuous, but it is divided into Frames for navigation. Frames have IDs that increment continuously, as well as absolute IDs used to find stitches (gaps) in the log recordings. Frames contain both CPU and GPU timestamps for their start and end points.
* **Timers (Scopes):** Sections of code instrumented so that entering and leaving them records timestamps in the profiling data. Each enter/leave pair forms a scope instance on the timeline. This includes both C++ Engine scopes (present by default) and user-added Luau scopes (present if executed at least once).
* **Groups:** Collections of Scopes, such as Physics, Scripts, Network, etc.
* **Threads:** OS threads. Each thread has its own parallel timeline and profiling data log, though known Scopes can appear in any thread. A typical unit of profiling is a Frame alongside its corresponding thread logs. The GPU thread is an exception: it is not an OS thread, but rather represents the execution of rendering processes on the GPU.
* **Counters:** Represent various Engine parameters at a specific moment in time (per Frame). They can show used/allocated memory per category (Physics, Luau heap, Render, etc.), allocations per second, or instance counts (e.g., scene objects processed). Counters are hierarchical: a base node might represent a total sum or act as a value-less container for child counters. The most specific counters are the leaf nodes.

Entities possess numeric IDs and are referenced by them. If an entity has a string name, helper functions can find its ID by name or search mask. IDs start from 1 - a value of 0 means the absence of an entity. Entities also have descriptors containing their ID, name, and specific parameters (such as a Timer's color).

### Iterators & Frame Boundaries

Iterators are a very powerful mechanism for processing performance data. Thread log iterators can process all thread log data, or be configured to process only specific scopes in specific threads within a specific frame range. At each step, they provide a detailed state, tracking the stack of scopes as we enter and leave them over time.

They can also be reused multiple times by rewinding to a new frame range. If a new frame range starts exactly where the previous one ended, the iterator continues smoothly without a cold start, preserving its last state. This is crucial for the following reason:

Scopes can cross frame boundaries. A single visual frame might contain the tail of a scope that started in the previous frame, and the beginning of another scope that finishes in a subsequent frame. In such cases, the scope time for the current frame is the sum of the partial scope durations that fit within that frame's borders. Do not attribute a scope instance solely to the frame where its exit entry appears. Instead, treat each scope instance as a time span and distribute its duration across every frame it overlaps.

When cold-starting on the first frame, you may encounter scope instances that started beforehand; thus, you will only see exit entries without their corresponding enter entries. Conversely, in the final frame, scopes may begin (showing an enter entry) but finish outside the range, lacking an exit entry.

Middle frames do not have these problems because the iterator tracks the current scope stack. This stack is preserved across frame boundaries, and the iterator explicitly marks the timestamps when scopes on the stack cross those borders. Even the corner cases described above can be successfully resolved using hints from the log iterator. It indicates when an exit entry causes a stack underflow and provides timestamps for when the next frame boundary is reached (even at the end of the last frame) and when each thread's read finishes within the frame, allowing you to calculate exactly what portion of a scope fits within the analyzed frame.

The iterator progresses frame by frame, and thread by thread within each frame. 

**Important Iterator Behaviors:**
* **GPU vs. CPU Timestamps:** When iterating over the GPU thread, be aware that timestamp origins and scales may differ from CPU timestamps - do not mix them. Additionally, a frame's overall GPU start and finish times may be too broad compared to the actual frame time, or may even contain inaccurate data, such as an end time earlier than the start time, or a frame without log entries where the next or previous frame spans multiple frames' duration and data. Still, continuous (almost gapless) sections of scopes within the GPU thread correctly represent GPU execution time, so the time spent within those sections should be used as your reference. Alternatively, frames with inaccurate GPU boundaries may be excluded from GPU-related analysis along with the surrounding frames. On some platforms, the GPU thread may be absent or empty.
* **Event Entries:** Besides scope enter/leave entries, there are Event entries representing metadata for scope instances (like memory allocations or network events); however, these are not currently supported.
* **Stitch Detection:** The log iterator detects stitches in frame capturing - based on absolute frame IDs - which occur if capturing is paused and resumed later.
* **Warm-ups:** When processing paused/snapshotted data (where real-time performance overhead is less critical), you can start iterating one frame early (if this frames exist). This "warms up" the scope stack before analyzing your target frame range, so you don't need to run a procedure to recover the initial stack state.

**Timing Types:**
Scope/Timer total times are inclusive, meaning the execution time of child scopes is included in their parent's time. If multiple instances of the same scope occur in the same frame across several threads, you can measure:
1. Total wall-time from the start of the first instance to the end of the last.
2. Real-world CPU active work time (excluding inactive periods between instances).
3. The sum of CPU core times spent (which can exceed real-world elapsed time due to parallelization).
Inclusive group totals are usually work volume, not frame duration.
Exact-stack total times can be used to identify wall-time bottlenecks in non-parallel cases. If the same exact stack runs concurrently on multiple threads, summing all instances gives work volume / occupancy across threads, not necessarily critical-path wall time. For real bottleneck diagnosis, inspect per-frame critical path and per-thread spans.

### Counters & Caching

The Counter iterator helps navigate the hierarchy of counters, which is more useful than a flat list. You can iterate over all counters, or specify certain counters as root elements to iterate only through them and their children. The iterator tracks the parent stack, its absolute depth, and its relative depth (relative to the specified root counter).

Using a counter ID, you can retrieve its last sample (where a sample consists of a `uint32` frame number and a `double` value) or all of its samples. Fetching the last sample is computationally cheaper. However, if you have already retrieved all samples and the MP data has not updated (which is typical for same-frame access during active capture, or indefinitely when paused), the data is cached, making subsequent accesses cheap. 

The same applies to basic entity descriptors (Threads, Timers, etc.). They are considered long-term data; once retrieved, assuming they haven't been changed or appended (which happens rarely), you will receive the cached data. Thus, executing `FetchTimerDesc(timerId)` frequently is perfectly fine.

### Data Retrieval: `Get***` vs `Fetch***`

The Luau LibMP API is a wrapper around a WebAssembly (WASM) module, and the returned structures utilize FlatBuffers. You will find `Get***` and `Fetch***` methods for the same data:

* **`Get***`** returns a FlatBuffer view (a Luau object/table) with getter functions to access original, non-copied data.
* **`Fetch***`** creates a native Luau table/struct containing a deep copy of each field.

Some `Get***` methods return a simple scalar value (e.g. the ID of a thread) and therefore do not have a corresponding `Fetch***` counterpart.

It is generally recommended to use `Fetch***` for simplicity, despite the slight performance overhead. Retrieving data via `Get***` is typically faster, especially when accessing only one field instead of the entire object. However, **a `Get***` view is strictly temporary and is invalidated by ANY subsequent `Get***` or `Fetch***` call on the Session object.** Therefore, fields must be accessed immediately after the `Get***` call. Accessing them later will result in reading garbage data. *(Note: The `session:WithDataLock()` method exists specifically to keep these views valid safely if necessary).* Additionally, in certain cases, `Get***` objects can actually be less performant than `Fetch***`. For example, accessing a string field from a `Get***` descriptor creates a new Luau string allocation every time. `Fetch***` allocates the string only once.

Arrays returned by `Get***` methods are exception - they persist until disposed. Be especially careful with them - you must dispose the returned arrays later. Also, if their elements are not simple scalars (e.g., arrays of IDs), retrieving individual elements from the array falls under the rules described above.

Another exception is Iterator State objects - you get them once via `iter:GetState()`, and they persist and are updated as long as the iterator exists.

### Notes

Sessions, Iterators and Arrays must be disposed of manually by calling the `Dispose()` method. Special attention should be given to Arrays - store them in a variable immediately after creating them with a `Get***` method (e.g., `GetCounterSamples`) so you can call `Dispose()` later. Otherwise, they will leak.

If you frequently query arrays and LibMP.GetMemUsed() reports an increasing amount of memory, it is almost certainly a leak.

The names of Scopes/Timers are typically self-explanatory, but Roblox provides a reference on their website. *Note: these names are sometimes referred to as Tags or even Labels, although the latter is not technically correct (In the Engine internals, a Label refers to an auxiliary string attached to a scope instance, not to its name).*

*(When writing scripts for deep capture analysis, monitor your script's execution time. If it takes excessively long, look for optimizations in your Luau script to speed up future runs).*

Lastly, you can manually save a dump to a file from the MicroProfiler top menu via "Dump" --> "Dump in binary format". This captures exactly the same data exposed to you in-game, including the frame limit you specified. The dump (.gprx file) can later be accessed in command-line Luau (Lute) using the same LibMP module described here.

Examples of usage in scripts, along with documentation for the API methods and structures, are provided below.

## Special notes for AI agents

In Studio, do not force a switch to Play mode if MicroProfiler data has already been captured and is static.

Use Studio MCP's `execute_luau` tool to run code snippets for interacting with MicroProfiler.

When mentioning frame IDs to the user, provide both the regular ID and the absolute ID, so the frame can be located programmatically and in the UI.

Always set the frame limit before operating on frame data. A user may also use LibMP in their game and configure a very low frame limit. If you do not override it, that limit will be inherited by default. Note, however, that changing the frame limit from its previous value clears the history of counter values.

**Data freezing: pausing and snapshotting**
* **No freezing (Live data):** Best for in-game scripts performing lightweight checks on real-time data without interrupting the ongoing capture.
* **Pausing MP:** Best for in-game scripts where your analysis consists of self-contained tasks executed entirely within a single frame.
* **Snapshotting:** Best for all other cases, including external script snippets or in-game analysis, where iteration over entities spans multiple frames.
* **Combined (pause + snapshot):** Use this only when you want the on-screen MP UI to visually freeze on the exact data you are analyzing via an external snippet. Make sure to unpause MP when finished.

Do not use `OpenFromLiveData` in `execute_luau`, open the session from a snapshot.

If a game is suspected to be GPU-bound because the GPU frame time is close to the CPU frame time, this does not automatically mean the workload is actually GPU-bound. The true active work time of the GPU can only be determined by examining the GPU thread scopes.

## LibMP API Documentation

LibMP is a universal MicroProfiler API. The Luau library is a wrapper around the WebAssembly C-API and utilizes FlatBuffers for highly efficient data serialization and extraction.

Syntax Note: All API methods are dynamic (called via `:`), with the exception of constructors like `Session.OpenFrom***` and direct global methods like `LibMP.***`, which use a dot (`.`).

---

### 1. Core Library (`LibMP`)

* **`LibMP.IsCliMode`** `(boolean)`: Returns `true` if the environment is a CLI.
* **`LibMP.GetMemUsed()`** `-> number`: Returns the current memory usage of the underlying WASM instance.
* **`LibMP.Versions`**: Instance of the `Versions` class. Contains `Versions.Library` and `Versions.DataFormat` `(number)`.
* **`LibMP.Control`**: A global `Control` instance. This maps exactly to **`LibMP.Control.Global`**.

---

### 2. Main Classes

#### `Control`
* **`:IsBackendReady()`** `-> boolean`: Checks if the API is ready to use (the remote is accessible and versions are compatible).
* **`:IsBackendAccessible()`** `-> boolean`: Checks if the remote API is accessible.
* **`:IsBackendVersionCompatible()`** `-> boolean`: Checks version capability.
* **`:EnableProfiler(enable: boolean)`** `-> boolean`: Toggles the profiler.
* **`:EnableCapture(enable: boolean)`** `-> boolean`: Activates/pauses data capture.
* **`:SetFrameLimit(num: number)`** `-> boolean`: Sets the rolling frame limit.
* **`:ShowUI(show: boolean)`** `-> boolean`: Toggles the on-screen UI (Studio-only feature).
* **`:CaptureToBufferSync()`** `-> buffer`: Captures the accumulated live data (collected frames) into a newly created buffer and returns it.
* **`:UseControlChannel(use: boolean)`** `-> boolean`: Enables or disables the control channel.

---

#### `Session`
Represents a MicroProfiler session - the main object you interact with. Contains internal caching mechanisms to optimize repetitive reads.

> **Important Return Type Distinction:**
> *   Methods prefixed with **`Get`** return a **FlatBuffer (FB) object view** (e.g., `FB view (TimerDesc)`). These views do not contain raw fields; you must call their getter methods to retrieve data (e.g., `obj:TimerName()`). Views must be accessed immediately, as they are invalidated by any subsequent `Get***` or `Fetch***` call. Array equivalents return wrapped arrays (e.g., `StructArray<FB.U64Sample>`) that persist until manually disposed. Iterator state returned via `:GetState()` persists and is updated as long as the iterator exists.
> *   Methods prefixed with **`Fetch`** return a **native Luau table** deeply unpacked from the FlatBuffer (e.g., `Luau table (TimerDesc)`). Properties are directly accessible fields (e.g., `obj.TimerName`). Array equivalents return standard Luau arrays of these tables (e.g., `Array of Luau tables (U64Sample)`).

##### Constructors
* **`Session.OpenFromMem(data: string | buffer)`** `-> Session?`: Opens a session from a string or buffer. Note that this method creates an internal copy of the provided string or buffer before working with it.
* **`Session.OpenFromBuffer(b: buffer)`** `-> Session?`: Opens a session from a raw Luau buffer object.
* **`Session.OpenFromSlot(id: number)`** `-> Session?`: Opens a session directly from a MicroProfiler data slot.
* **`Session.OpenFromFile(path: string, [cacheSize: number])`** `-> Session?`: Opens a session from a file.
* **`Session.OpenFromLiveData()`** `-> Session?`: Opens from data slot 0 in Roblox Engine, or from a file path provided via command-line arguments in CLI mode.
* **`Session.OpenFromExternalProvider(io: table, [cacheSize: number])`** `-> Session?`: Advanced constructor requiring a custom IO handler.

##### Lifecycle & State
* **`:Dispose()`** `-> nil`: Cleans up and unregisters the session.
* **`:IsValid()`** `-> boolean`: Checks if the session is valid.
* **`:GetDataFormatVersion()`** `-> number`: Returns the session's data format version.
* **`:GetObjSize()`** `-> number`: Returns the size of the last accessed object. If caching is enabled (default behavior), this will not reflect the size of objects that were cached and later accessed again.
* **`:WithDataLock(callback: function)`** `-> (boolean, any)`: Safely locks the first accessed object data, executes the callback, and automatically unlocks (returning success status and callback result). This is only required in specific cases where you retrieve a data view via a `Get***` method and need to ensure it does not expire or get overwritten after subsequent `Get***` calls. **Mechanism:** The data view returned by the *first* `Get***` method executed within the lock helper will persist and remain valid until the callback finishes and the lock is released.

##### Synchronization & Caching
* **`:SyncWithDataSource()`** `-> boolean`: Synchronizes the session with its active data source. Live data sessions call this method automatically when you first access their data after it has been updated (e.g., a new game frame arrives).
* **`:SetSyncRequired()`** `-> nil`: Marks the session as requiring a sync on the next data access.
* **`:SetClearCacheOnSyncRequired()`** `-> nil`: Flags the cache to be cleared upon the next synchronization.
* **`:SyncIfRequired()`** `-> nil`: Executes a sync if `SetSyncRequired()` was previously called.
* **`:EnableObjectCache(enabled: boolean)`** `-> nil`: Toggles the Luau-side and C-side object caching for descriptors. Caching is enabled by default.
* **`:ClearObjectCache()`** `-> nil`: Force-clears the cache.
* **`:ClearLuauCacheBucket(bucketIdx: number)`** `-> nil`: Clears a specific bucket in the Luau cache (1 = ShortTerm, 2 = LongTerm).
